# FLASK_API_BACKEND
Creating backend with flask

### Notes ###
This is the backend version of the FLASK_API in my repository where we fetch data.
The backend uses a file system storage rather than a database like SQLite or MongoDB or any other database.
As a result of the above, a Model is created to interact and update the db.json as a database.
The essence of the db.json is to have an independent data interaction. 
You can challenge yourself by integrating with a database like MongoDb or SQLite or even Django.

To find this repository readily useful, download my FLASK_API_FRONTEND repository and do some crud operations.

# How to use #
Install the following
1. Python
2. Flask

run in your terminal pointing to the file location with 
flask run --debug
.....Your server is now live in your localhost
